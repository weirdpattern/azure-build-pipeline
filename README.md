## Contributing

PRs are always welcome, but to maximize contributions and ensure a healthy 
environment we encourage contributors to follow these guidelines:

- All work must be done on branches, never work directly on master. 
- Branches must be named appropriately. 
- One feature (job/step/etc) per branch.
- One PR per feature.
- All PRs are subject to code review, so keep an open mind.
